# Orthodox Lectionary Desktop Overlay
An elegant desktop overlay with daily commemorations and lectionary readings for Orthodox Christians.
The program is completely offline and follows the "new calendar" Orthodox liturgical cycle.

Readings are taken from the New King James Version (NKJV), the same version used in the popular Orthodox Study Bible.
